8.Project_Numbers_Array_Class CS1337
Design a class that has an array of floating-point numbers. The constructor should accept an integer argument and dynamically allocate the array to hold that many numbers. The destructor should free the memory held by the array. In addition, there should be member functions to perform the following operations:
• Store a number in any element of the array
• Retrieve a number from any element of the array
• Return the highest value stored in the array
• Return the lowest value stored in the array
• Return the average of all the numbers stored in the array
Demonstrate the class in a program.
Here is the sample input
```
5
45
55
65
75
85
```

Here is the corresponding output
```
Here are the numbers you entered:
Number 1: 45
Number 2: 55
Number 3: 65
Number 4: 75
Number 5: 85

---------------------------------
The average of those numbers is: 65
The highest of those numbers is: 85
The lowest  of those numbers is: 45
```
